I am a Full-stack Developer exploring new technologies (in particular ML/NLP) and doing sometimes electronics/3d printing stuff.

 🔭 I’m actually working on: **[WeSkill](https)**.

 🌱 I’m currently learning time to time:

			- Natural Language Processing on Coursera
			- Java Spring (learning it on the job by making WeSkill project)

ℹ️ Most of my biggest projects are not public on GitHub, this includes:

- WeSkill: a website classifying and showing which technologies are the most in-demand in the swiss labor market
- AnimalTracker (temporal name): a tracker for animals, including electronics/3d design/C & C++ programming/Data gathering for Business Intelligence/Laravel backend
- And others websites or testing projects that I prefer not to make public

 💬 Ask me about Full Stack Development, if you need help on any of my projects or any other related stuff.
