I am a Full-stack Developer exploring new technologies (in particular ML/NLP) and doing sometimes electronics/3d printing stuff.

 🔭 I’m actually working on: **[WeSkill](https://weskill.ch/)** and **[3D Printed Robot 2020](https://github.com/DardanIljazi/3d-Printed-Robot-2020/)**.

 🌱 I’m currently learning time to time:

	- Natural Language Processing on Coursera
	- Java Spring (learning it on the job by making WeSkill project)

ℹ️ Most of my biggest projects are not public on GitHub, this includes:

- WeSkill: a website classifying and showing which technologies are the most in-demand in the swiss labor market
- AnimalTracker (temporal name): a tracker for animals, including electronics/3d design/C & C++ programming/Data gathering for Business Intelligence/Laravel backend
- (#hidden-name): My diploma work that consists of scrapping data for a given subject and see how this subject spread over internet and over time
- USBHid: A project that consists to make a little Remote Administration Tool for fun, to test Node.js, Websockets, C++ and Web Application Messaging Protocol
- And others websites or testing projects that I prefer not to make public for now
